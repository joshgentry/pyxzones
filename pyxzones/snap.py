            # one dimension, but it remains on the other

            # UPDATE: After some digging, these appear to be GTK3.0 windows with default
            # margin CSS rules applied. The only fix _seems_ to be having tiling WM users
            # (and pyxzones users) add custom user styling to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css
            # to remove the margin, if the window positioning oddness bothers them.
            #
            # NOTE: There seems to be an early GTK3.0 version of the fix targeting the
            # "window-frame" CSS class and a newer fix targeting "window > decoration"
